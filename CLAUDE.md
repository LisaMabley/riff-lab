# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

Riff Lab (working name) is a fashion community built on **remixes**: someone posts a look, others post their own interpretations, and the remix network is the product. The full product and architecture spec is [riff-lab-plan.md](riff-lab-plan.md). Read the relevant section before building a feature, and don't invent answers to its open questions (§19). Ask instead.

## Status

Phase 1 (invite-only friends beta) is in progress. So far: the database foundation for users (profiles and the 18+ check), RLS, and tests. **Not started:** posts, images, and remixes; the Expo app (`apps/` is empty); sign-in; everything after that. Build phase by phase (§17), extending the schema with new migrations rather than modeling future phases up front. Check §4 "Out of scope" and §20 before adding anything.

## Work in small chunks

Lisa reviews every change, so size work like a team ticket: about 3–5 story points, roughly a day or two of focused work.

- **PR size:** aim for 400 changed lines or fewer. Treat 800 as the ceiling. Generated files (`database.types.ts`), lockfiles, and snapshots don't count toward the limit. Call them out in the PR description instead.
- **Backlog:** [BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md) is the ticket list and the home for open questions that come up while building. Mark tickets done as they land, and add new questions there instead of guessing.
- **Plan first:** before starting a feature, break it into tickets, each one small enough to fit the limit and useful on its own. Propose the list and let Lisa approve it before writing code. If a ticket turns out bigger than expected while you're building it, stop and propose a split. Don't keep going.
- **Slice vertically:** each PR should be a thin, complete piece, for example one table with its RLS, grants, and pgTAP tests. Avoid layers that don't work yet ("all the migrations now, all the policies later").
- **Tests stay in the same PR as the code they cover**, so `main` never has untested rules. Put them in their own commit if that makes the diff easier to read.
- **Commits inside a PR:** each commit does one thing and leaves the repo passing `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, and the relevant tests. Separate refactors and renames from behavior changes.
- **PR description:** what this ticket does, what's left for later tickets, and how to verify it.

## Commands

pnpm workspaces + Turborepo. The Supabase CLI is a root devDependency (`pnpm supabase …`). Local Supabase needs Docker, and on Windows Docker Desktop needs WSL 2.

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm typecheck | pnpm lint | pnpm test      # turbo across packages
pnpm format                                 # prettier (supabase/ and *.md are ignored)

pnpm db:start        # local Supabase stack (Studio URL etc. via `pnpm supabase status`)
pnpm db:reset        # re-apply migrations + supabase/seed.sql
pnpm test:db         # all pgTAP tests (supabase test db)
pnpm db:types        # regenerate packages/supabase/src/database.types.ts (currently a placeholder)

# single tests
pnpm --filter @riff-lab/core exec vitest run src/age.test.ts
pnpm supabase test db supabase/tests/database/00010_profiles.test.sql
```

`supabase/tests/database/00000_helpers.test.sql` installs the `tests.*` helpers and must run before the other test files: a full `pnpm test:db` does this, and the helpers then persist until the next `db:reset`. Run the full suite once after a reset before running a single file.

## Layout

- `supabase/migrations/`: the schema. This is where the product rules live (see below).
- `supabase/tests/database/`: pgTAP, one file per area. Helpers: `tests.create_user`, `tests.create_profile`, `tests.authenticate_as(identifier)`, `tests.authenticate_as_anon`, `tests.authenticate_without_user`, `tests.as_superuser`. Test usernames must satisfy the 3–30 character rule.
- `packages/core`: framework-free domain helpers and zod schemas (username, `isAdult`, limits) that mirror database rules for client-side feedback. **The database is the source of truth.** When a rule or limit changes, change the migration, `packages/core/src/limits.ts`, and both test suites together.
- `packages/supabase`: generated `Database` types for the future app.
- `packages/tsconfig`: shared strict tsconfig. TypeScript is pinned to 6.0 because typescript-eslint doesn't support 7 yet.

## Architecture rules

**Logic placement:** database (constraints, triggers, RLS) first, then Supabase Edge Functions, then a small Hono/Node service only if needed. See the table in spec §16.

**RLS and grants (every migration):**
- Enable RLS on every table in `public`. `00001_schema_guards.test.sql` fails if one is missing.
- Supabase's default privileges grant `anon`/`authenticated` everything on new `public` tables. Each migration therefore `revoke all … from anon, authenticated` and grants back only what's needed, using **column-level grants** for immutable fields (e.g. `grant update (display_name, bio) on public.profiles`).
- Writes that need server-side checks go through `security definer` RPCs (e.g. `complete_onboarding`) with `set search_path = ''` and fully qualified names. Revoke `execute` from `public, anon`.
- Every policy, grant, and trigger ships with pgTAP tests for both the allowed and the denied case.

**18+ and birth dates:** `complete_onboarding(username, display_name, birth_date)` compares the birth date and discards it. Only `profiles.age_confirmed_at` is stored. It is read-only for users (left out of the column update grant) and is visible to other signed-in users, which reveals nothing beyond `created_at`. Never store, return, or log a birth date (keep Postgres parameter logging off). A schema guard test rejects any `birth`/`dob` column. More generally, don't keep personal data we have no use for.

**Non-negotiables from the spec (for upcoming work):**
- One "remixed from" link per post. Remixes outlive their original and show a neutral "Original not available" placeholder (§3).
- Each tag is stored once; private tag assignments live in their own table, readable only by the assigner (admins included).
- EXIF/GPS is stripped on the server.
- Favorites never leak: no notification, count, or list, and no effect on ranking.
- Blocks are bidirectional and enforced in RLS.

## Product language

- "Remix" everywhere (`Remix this`, `12 remixes`, `remixed from @maya`).
- "Favorite", never "bookmark."
- Applause has no public count.
- The remix count is the one public number, hidden at zero.
- Placeholder and moderation copy stays vague ("Original not available," never "removed for violating rules").
- When unsure whether a feature belongs, apply the guiding question in spec §22.
